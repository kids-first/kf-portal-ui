### Welcome to your new Kids First Cavatica project!

The Kids-First DRC has partnered with Cavatica to bring easy and collaborative cloud computing to the Kids-First datasets.

Projects are the core building blocks of the Cavatica Platform. Each project corresponds to a distinct scientific investigation, serving as a container for its data, analysis pipelines, and results. Projects can be shared with designated project members.

#### Within your project, you can:

- Start [Analyzing your Kids-First Data](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/u/<username>/<project-name>/files/)
- [Install your tools](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/sdk-overview) and create workflows
- Supplement analysis by [Uploading your own private data](http://docs.cavatica.org/docs/upload-your-data-to-cavatica)
- [Collaborate securely](http://docs.cavatica.org/docs/collaboration) with other researchers

You can use this space to add notes about your project such as its aims, experimental context, and any other ideas that you’d like to share with your project members. as everyone will see the same content. (Bonus: This area is supported by [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatting!)

Remember that details of each pipeline execution you run on the Cavatica Platform are logged on the dedicated task page.
